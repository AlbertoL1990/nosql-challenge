This challenge involves working with a MongoDB database containing food hygiene ratings for establishments in the UK. The goal is to set up the database, perform updates based on specific requirements from a food magazine, and conduct exploratory analysis to answer key questions about the data. The analysis will help the magazine's editors and food critics decide where to focus their future articles.
